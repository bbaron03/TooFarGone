# TooFarGone
A 2D Platformer Space Adventure

Too Far Gone is a platformer adventure game with progressively harder levels. Dexter McAstronaut is an astronaut who got sucked through a wormhole and is now lost on a random alien planet. The object of the game is to venture around the planet and reach his damaged ship in under 3 days time before the wormhole will close. He must collect one item to repair his spaceship on each of the three levels of increasing difficulty and avoid alien enemies to win the game.

This game was made thanks to Cary, Samuel and I during the NYU Coding for Game Design Camp. We were tasked with creating a game from the top-down in one week. I created the idea of McAstronaut and it was voted as one of the games that will actually move into development. Although there are still some bugs, it was such a fun process to learn about and test all different game mechanics, such as a health bar, loading screen, and different levels with stats that save. I was amazed to see what we were able to accomplish, it was such a rewarding process. I am now working on a game called Bird Knight that hopefully will be up here too.

I am uploading the Unity Source Code and a playable link below for anyone who is interested in seeing how each mechanic is coded.

NOTE: Must go fullscreen, but there are still things cut off on the web player version. The right Day and Night meter counts up to night 3 and that is the time limit.
